# Rules

## Goals

- The last player to play all of their cards loses and becomes the Shithead

### Playing

- Players take turns playing cards clock-wise around the table
- Players must always play the same card or higher than the previous player unless a special card is in effect
- Players pick up the pile of all played cards and place it in their hand when they cannot play a card on their turn
  - Players lose their turn when they pick up the pile
- Players play cards from their hands until no more cards remain in their hand
  - Players must play cards from their hand while cards remain in their hand
- Players play the face-up cards placed in front of them when they have no cards in their hand
  - Players cannot play face-down cards while they have any face-up cards
- Players play their face-down cards when they have no face-up cards to play
  - Players cannot pick up and look at their face-down cards
- Players must play if they can do so
- Players draw the number of cards as they play while there are cards available in the draw-pile

## Setup

## Cards

- All cards rank in their natural order. Aces are high, suits are disregarded
- Multiple cards of the same rank from players' hands and face-up cards can be played at the same time
- A set of four of the same cards takes all currently played cards out of the game
  - The player that takes all currently played cards out of the game plays again
  - Players that can complete the set of all four cards for the currently played card can do so even if it is not their turn

### Special Cards

- 3: The card underneath the played 3 is still in effect
- 10: Takes all currently played cards out of the game
  - The player that played 10 plays again
- Joker: Reverses the direction of play

#### Cards that have to be played in natural order

- 7: The next player must play 7 or below 7
- 8: Skips the next player
  - The number of played 8 determines how many players are skipped
  - Players cannot skip themselves

#### Extensions

- 4: The next player must play a card of the same color as the played 4
  - 4 can be played on any 4, no matter the color
- Q: Reverses the direction of play
